  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed by our application ("the Application").</p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>Since it's a wallpaper app, it creates live or image wallpapers and sets them to your device’s home screen when you click the "Set Wallpaper" button.</p>
  <p>The Application does not offer account creation, so we do not store or access any personal data. All data is stored locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>Permissions Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Read External Storage</strong> – Required if you want to add your own photo to set as wallpaper.</li>
    <li><strong>Set Wallpaper</strong> – Required to apply the wallpaper on your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Device Data</h2>
  <p>We collect device-related data such as device model, name, identifiers, settings, app ID, and crash logs. This helps us fix bugs and improve our services.</p>

  <h2>Event and Usage Data</h2>
  <p>We process data related to your usage of our services, such as which app screens you visit. This is aggregated to help improve functionality and user experience.</p>

  <h2>IP Address</h2>
  <p>We collect your IP address for statistical analysis, service delivery, and regulatory compliance. We do not collect precise location data.</p>

  <h2>Email Support</h2>
  <p>We collect your email only when you contact us for support, and only use it for communication regarding your query.</p>

  <h2>Analytics</h2>
  <p>We do not collect crash or usage data without your consent. If consent is given, we use analytics to improve our app, such as which features are most used.</p>

  <ul>

    <li>Facebook Analytics – <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation">Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services help us collect anonymized usage and crash data to improve the app.</p>

  <h2>Advertising</h2>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Firebase retains crash stack traces for 180 days. Instance IDs are kept until deleted by request.</p>
